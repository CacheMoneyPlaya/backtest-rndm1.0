Backtesting of a fair value gap trading strategy on a rolling 300 data point input

## TODO:
- Move FVG shading anchor to start of detection date &#x2611;
- Filter out invalidated FVG zones at point of consumption &#x2611;
- Begin defining a set of entry strats depending on the last n-(10 to 20) candle movements &#x2611;
- Build in entry/exit position commands + fit to 1:1.5 or something &#x2611;
- Clean up a load of shit for plug and play of strats, bit messy atm as i was just wanting to get soemthing working lol


- Backtested with 10x leverage and numbers are shown in the above PnL chart, shit cant be true surely? Got to be some fuckery going on
